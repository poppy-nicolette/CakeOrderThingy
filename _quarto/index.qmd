# Welcome to mom&kid's Cake Order Thingy!

## Order your cake now! 

![](images/amethyst%20beach.gif)

What kind of cake base would you like?

Choices are:

-   Victoria sponge

-   Devils' food

-   chocolate

-   yellow

```{}
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
